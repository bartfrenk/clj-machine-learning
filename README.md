# Machine learning algorithms in Clojure

## Description

Repository for Clojure implementations of machine learning algorithms. Currently contains:

- Online estimators for the sample mean and sample variance. See [[1]](#ippel).
- The Viterbi algorithm. See for example Chapter 13 of [[2]](#bishop). 

Purely for learning, and not (yet) for use in actual applications.
